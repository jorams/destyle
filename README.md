# Destyle

Destyle is a work-in-progress attempt at creating a CSS parser in CL. It is a very (very) na√Øve implementation of [this][w3ccr] W3C Candidate Recommendation.

Currently (mostly) implemented is the tokenization step.

[w3ccr]: http://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/

## Goals

A long-term goal is to implement [Less][less] implementation in Common Lisp.

[less]: http://lesscss.org/

Another idea I've had is to build a CSS analyzer that suggests ways to improve your CSS/Less, because CSS tends to turn into a horrible mess. Pre-processors like Less help to fix this a little bit, but some more guidance might be nice at times.

## TODO

Pretty much everything.
